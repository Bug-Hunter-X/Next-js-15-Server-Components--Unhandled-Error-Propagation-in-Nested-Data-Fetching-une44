In Next.js 15, an uncommon error arises when using server components with deeply nested data fetching.  If a component fetches data that depends on data fetched by a parent component, and an error occurs in the parent component's data fetching, the error might not properly propagate to the child component. Instead, the child component might render with stale data or a completely unexpected state, making debugging difficult. This is because the error handling mechanisms might not seamlessly handle the asynchronous nature of nested data fetching in server components.
